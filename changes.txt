# Updated to be compatible with Python version 3.12+

Changed bronxbot.py to main.py, new bronxbot.py is only for the class and its specific functions

Bot events are modularized and placed in a separate folder(botEvents.[botevent])

Stats.py added for stat_tracker class and functions

Certain stat functions have been put in bronxbot.py due to the nature of the code, no other way around it

All cog classes, events, etc. moved into cogInfo.py

imports.py file created for easy imports and to avoid 50 lines of just imports

main.py file condensed from 800+ lines to just 44

Not updated to latest git push, updating should be easy, just copy paste to respective files

Upload your own config.json, shop.json, stats.json, etc. Shop.json seems to be bugging, see if you can fix that ks

Read notes scattered around new files for extra details

For ks: Feel free to change things if they don't work, are named strangely, or just aren't to your liking
